# Homework 4: Project Plan

> Identify a project you would like to migrate into the template format provided
  below, and then do so. IT projects, based on your personal experience (from
  industry, or school), are strongly encouraged in order to strengthen the
  relationship between what we learn in class and how to use this information in
  an IT environment. But, as there are students who take this class with no IT
  background, it is NOT a requirement that this assignment be based on an IT
  project. This will NOT be presented in class.
