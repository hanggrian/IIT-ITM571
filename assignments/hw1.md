AMD entered the consumer microprocessor market in the early 1980s and again in
the 2000s with the purchase of the graphics company ATI. However, their products
had always been regarded as inferior to Intel's and Nvidia's offerings, as
illustrated by the sales numbers where Intel and Nvidia owned the majority of
market share in their respective industry.<sup>[\[1\]]</sup> This sentiment
continued well into the 2010s when AMD struggled with financial losses in
consecutive quarters, which plunged them into billions of dollars in debt.<sup>[\[2\]]</sup>

The company then appointed Lisa Su, a gifted electrical engineer and
well-respected technical leader in the industry. She quickly began the
development of the next generation of CPU architecture intended to capture a
larger target audience beyond desktop computers named Zen. One of the defining
characteristics of Zen architecture is the chiplet technology, which essentially
is a combination of sub-CPUs into the same die. This scientific breakthrough has
allowed AMD to repurpose defects, thereby increasing yields and cost-efficiency
in the manufacturing process.<sup>[\[3\]]</sup>

The result has been a resounding success, with the company's shares rising 1300%
in value. Nowadays, AMD processors are commonplace in servers,
workstations and laptops. They are not only cheaper than their Intel equivalents
but more technologically advanced as well. To add insult to injury, AMD has also
defeated Nvidia in powering the latest generation of gaming consoles such as
*Microsoft Xbox*, *Sony PlayStation* and the portable *Steam Deck* from *Valve*.

For single-handedly saving AMD from the brink of collapse, Lisa Su is my role
model in leadership. In a bid to transform the company, she disregarded the
previous approach of playing it safe and took a massive risk, which paid off
immensely. She is an engineering and business genius in an industry dominated by
male leaders. In addition, she is known for her humility and sense of humor,
making her an asset in every media presence. Being an Asian-American, she is
truly an inspiration for the next generation of minorities aspiring to work
in technology.
