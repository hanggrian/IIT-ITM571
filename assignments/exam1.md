  will receive paychecks from the Bill and Malinda Gates Foundation (I have a
  signed agreement with the foundation for them to pay for people helping me).
  The website will be up and running within 3 months. I have built similar web
  sites for my personal use and enjoyment in 7 weeks, and will start work on
  this new web site after my morning coffee tomorrow. I use 1-and-1 for my web
  site hosting, an, quite frankly, I am delighted with their services.
