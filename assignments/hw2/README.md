# Homework 2: Using Microsoft Project

> You are to create a project schedule using MS Project (or similar). I will
  teach you how to use MS Project 2 class sessions before the assignment is due.
  The project schedule should either be for:
>
> - An IT project you worked on, or are planning to do. IT projects based on
    your personal experience are strongly encouraged in order to strengthen the
    relationship between what we learn in class and how to use this information
    in an IT environment.
> - A physical construction project. (building a kitchen, building a bathroom
    etc)
> - Any other project you want to make a project schedule for. (some people use
    their hobbies)
>
> **Your document you save in Blackboard MUST be either a PDF (preferred) or
  screen prints. If this is not the case then weâ€™ll give you a ZERO on the
  assignment.**

![Software development plan overview.](https://github.com/hendraanggrian/IIT-ITM571/raw/assets/assignments/hw2/overview.png)
:::

For this assignment, the software development plan of my choosing is the
**Chicago Transit Authority (CTA)**, heavily inspired by personal experience
during my stay in the city. However, the scope of this software excludes
internal operations such as railway management, safety protocols, and corporate
software like CRMs and ERPs. Instead, my software development plan handles
commuters' convenience in tracking public transportation schedules and paying
fares to use them, equivalent to the **Ventra** website and mobile applications.
The project will follow a five-phase development cycle (requirements gathering,
design, development, deployment, and review) with an estimated timeframe of 6
months, beginning in July 2024 and concluding in December 2024.
